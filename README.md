# Chess Engine by Gabriel Guimaraes

The goal is to create a efficient chess engine that can play against a human player. Later in the future I will implement a AI.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have python 3.6 or higher installed.
2. Make sure you have pygame installed. If not, run `pip install pygame` in your terminal.
3. Dowload/clone the repository.
4. Run `python main.py` in your terminal.

## What I'm currently working on

This project is still a work in progress. I'm currently working on the following features:

- [ ] Implement drag and drop.
- [ ] Generate pseudo legal moves for each piece.
- [ ] Move validation.
